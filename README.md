A guide to learning Kotlin (fast!) for developers who can already code in other languages.

## Overview
This repo contains a document and code examples that cover the core principles of using the Kotlin programming language. I developed it as I needed to get up to speed with Kotlin as quickly as possible, and figured that my notes / write-up might be useful to any other devs who may need to learn Kotlin, too.

## Erata / Feedback
Any and all feedback is cordially invited =D Please feel free to raise an issue if you feel something isn't quite right, or make some changes and submit a pull request if you'd prefer. If taking the PR route and modifying the Word document (whether in Word or LibreOffice or similar), please be aware that `Track Changes` is enabled in the document, so please leave it on when making any adjustments so I can see what's changed & where (although you don't have to update the PDF or HTML document versions - I'm happy to take care of that).

To protect your anonymity, prior to pushing any changed version of the document you may wish to create a version with all metadata removed by (in Windows) right-clicking on the document, then selecting *Properties* from the pop-up menu, then in the *Details* tab click *Remove Properties and Personal Information* then make sure *Create a copy with all possible properties remove* is selected and click *[OK]*:

### TODO:
- Add/edit text in chapters that are missing write-up (all the code is there - just not some of the discussion around it).
- Add Windows versions of IntelliJ IDEA projects (I don't think Linux projects open cleanly in Windows? Or is it that Windows projects don't open cleanly in Linux? Anyways, check & try to get a single set of projects across Linux/Windows - and failing that create Windows versions of the projects).
- Fix issue with bad/missing characters in HTML version of document as rendered via github pages.
